# human-activity-recogntion
This project focuses on Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify human activities such as walking, running, sitting, standing, etc., based on sensor data (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope) collected from smartphones or wearable devices.

The repository contains code for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. The project is implemented in Python and leverages popular libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Pandas.
